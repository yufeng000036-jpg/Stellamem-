# Stellamem

### Give AI memory a Git.

**Stellamem is a Markdown-first, Local-first long-term memory compiler for AI agents.**
It lets AI memory be inspected, explained, versioned, and rolled back.

Stellamem — Compilable, auditable, local-first long-term memory for AI agents.

> ⚠️ **Alpha**: currently `v0.1.0-alpha`. Security boundaries are still being hardened — read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before using on important data.

## What it solves

- **A digestive system for AI**: daily conversation logs are automatically compiled into structured long-term memory (preferences, decisions, lessons, projects), with deduplication, routing, and storage.
- **Memory rot**: long-running AI memory degrades and contradicts itself. Stellamem uses a conflict log and version chain so memory is governed like a codebase.
- **White-box transparency**: all memory is markdown. Humans can read it, Git can diff it, every cognitive change has an evidence chain.
- **Model-agnostic**: the extraction layer is a standardized Claim extraction task. Swap in a stronger model, get higher quality memory. 4B is the recommended starting point, not the ceiling.

## How it works

```text
AI conversation
→ auto diary (hooks/daily-autolog)
→ daily/*.md
→ compile (compiler/extract.py, local model)
→ structured Claims (kind / subject / predicate / value / confidence)
→ route (compiler/sleep_purify.py)
→ markdown memory (core / long-term / semantic)
→ adapter injects into AI context (adapters/openclaw)
```

Write side and inject side are two independent components. Both are required:
`hooks/` handles "AI conversation → diary", `adapters/` handles "memory → AI context".
See `docs/INTEGRATION.md`.

## Directory layout

```text
compiler/      Compile and routing scripts
hooks/         Write side: auto diary hook
adapters/      Inject side: framework adapters
templates/     Empty memory structure templates
demo/          Fictional user, 7 days of diary + one-click demo
benchmark/     Evaluation tools
docs/          Documentation
schema.md      Claim spec
config.example.json  Config template
```

---

## Quick start

1. Copy config: `cp config.example.json config.json`, fill in your paths and model name.
2. Create memory structure: see `templates/` for `core / long-term / semantic`.
3. Start model service, run `compiler/extract.py` to compile diaries.
4. Install write side: `hooks/daily-autolog/`.
5. Install inject side: `adapters/openclaw/`.

Full steps in `docs/INTEGRATION.md`.

## Performance ceiling: model-swappable, no fixed limit

Stellamem's compile quality is not tied to any single model. The extraction layer is a standardized Claim extraction task. Any text model that outputs JSON can be plugged in.

| Tier | Model | Hardware | Per-diary | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Default | Qwen3-4B Q5_K_M | 8GB VRAM | ~7s | Local, zero cost |
| Light | Qwen3-1.7B Q5 | 4GB VRAM | ~3s | Low-end devices |
| Advanced | Qwen3-14B / 32B | 16–24GB VRAM | hardware-dependent | Quality first |
| Cloud | GPT-4o / Claude / DeepSeek | API | network-dependent | Highest quality |

No fixed ceiling. Stronger models mean more accurate extraction, cleaner deduplication, more reliable conflict resolution.
The architecture, schema, and routing logic are model-agnostic — swapping models does not require changing your memory structure.

## Current setup and measured data

- Default model: Qwen3-4B Q5_K_M (llama.cpp)
- Backend: llama.cpp + CUDA, n_ctx = 8192
- Measured speed: ~7s per diary, 73 tok/s
- VRAM: fully offloadable on 8GB
- Cost: zero (local)

---

## Hardware requirements

- Recommended: 8GB VRAM + llama.cpp, running Qwen3-4B Q5_K_M.
- Advanced: 16GB VRAM for larger models.
- No GPU: CPU works but is 10x+ slower; or use a cloud API.

## Benchmark

30 real diaries: recall 0.705, False Write 0.

> Note: early internal evaluation. Matching method is still being iterated. A reproducible benchmark will be published; feel free to verify.

## When to use / when not to

Use: local-first, auditable, version-controlled long-term memory for long-running AI assistants.

Avoid: if you want a turnkey SaaS, prefer no command line, or only need short-term context.

## FAQ

**Can I use Claude / GPT?**
Yes. The extraction layer is model-agnostic; any JSON-output model works.

**Where is memory stored? Is it uploaded?**
Local markdown files by default, Git-diffable, no network. Content is only sent to a service provider if you explicitly configure a cloud model API.

**Does a stronger model help?**
Yes. Stronger models mean higher recall, fewer false writes. 4B is the default starting point, not the ceiling.

**How is this different from Mem0 / Zep?**
Markdown-first, diffable, rollback-capable, white-box auditable — not a black-box database.

**Which agent frameworks are supported?**
OpenClaw currently; more adapters coming.
